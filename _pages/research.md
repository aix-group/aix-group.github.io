Our research mission is to contribute to reliable AI methods for different modalities that can safely be applied in practice. 
Our research areas include:
- <a href="#topic-xai">Explainable and User-centric AI</a>
- <a href="#topic-nlp">Natural Language Processing</a>
- <a href="#topic-ai">Multimodal AI in Applications</a>

*"Why does the model think this patient has stage 3 cancer?"*, *"The model says I am not creditworthy - but why, and what actions can I take to obtain the credit?"*. 
If AI models (more specifically, machine learning models) are used in decision-support systems, such questions naturally arise. The field of eXplainable AI (XAI) developed methods to elicit such explanations of model behavior targeting various stakeholders (e.g., decision makers, machine learning researchers). 

Our research contributes to a new generation of **intrinsically interpretable models**, **conversational XAI**, **evaluation standards** for XAI methods, and **XAI methods** for various machine learning methods. We also aim to understand the **AI-user relationship** in applications.

"What do you mean?" - Using information from texts in application or creating conversational interfaces requires an understanding of this unstructured, non-standardized, individualized source of information. 

Our research contributes towards **understanding** of capabilities and limitations of current **large-language models**, and novel solutions in various **domain-specific NLP tasks** (i.e., text simplification, de-identification and structuring of medical reports).

*"Theory and practice sometimes clash. And when that happens, theory loses. Every single time."* (Linus Torvalds, Message to Linux kernel mailing list. 2009-03-25)



Applying machine learning to practical problems is not straightforward. Many (implicit) assumptions made when developing against benchmark data sets need to be relaxed (e.g., data quality, availability of annotations, available data set size) leading to different research questions. In sensitive domain, special attention has to be paid to legally compliant [compute infrastructures](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9750320). 

We adapt and apply machine learning techniques to **various domains and data** answering relevant practical questions. We are especially interested in the **medical domain** with its varying data quality and high multi-modality (text, structured data, 2D and 3D imagery, sensor data).
