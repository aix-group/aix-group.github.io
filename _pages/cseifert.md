## About 
I am a Full Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics at the Philipps-University Marburg, Germany and the Hessian Center for Artificial Intelligence.
I have been excited about all flavors of machine learning for a long time. In particular, I am passionate about bridging the gap between algorithmics and the human. I strongly believe that algorithms should be designed in a way that tightly integrates the user and her mental models of her material world, and the (immaterial) data collected to describe it; Artificial intelligences should be able to explain their reasoning and basis of decision-making to end users â€” in a way that relates to their physical reality and that they can understand. In consequence, my research is characterised by interdisciplinarity and a broad range of application areas. 
My core research interests are <a href="research#topic-xai">explainable and user-centric AI</a>, <a href="research#topic-nlp">natural language processing</a>, and <a href="research#topic-ml">machine learning</a>. 

I hold a Ph.D. from the Technical University Graz, Austria (Thesis Topic: Visually Supported Supervised Machine Learning) and a diploma (equiv. M.Sc.) in computer science from the Technical University Chemnitz, Germany.
