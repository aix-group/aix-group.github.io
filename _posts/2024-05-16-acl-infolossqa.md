How can we recover what has been lost in text simplification?

Text simplification aims to make texts more accessible to a broader audience. Simplification, however, is inherently a lossy process. Additionally, one simplification might not fit all -- readers have different background knowledge and information needs. 
How do we know which information is lost in a simplified version, and can readers help to iteratively recover the information?

InfoLossQA is a framework to identify and recover information loss as question-answer pairs.
See the website, demo and paper for more details.
