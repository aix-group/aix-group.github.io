The **AI-Lab: AI & Society** project has been awarded the **Hessian University Teaching Prize**! This recognition reflects the passion, creativity, and hard work of everyone involved—especially the student leaders who turned an ambitious idea into a vibrant, interdisciplinary learning environment.

The AI-Lab began as a lunch conversation between **Ali Kholmovai** and **Tim Ushakov**, who were bachelor students at the time. Since then, it has grown into a dynamic platform where students from a wide range of fields collaborate, prototype, and discuss the future of human–AI coexistence. With support from the organizers of the Marburg Module, **Nadine Schlicker** from the Institute of AI in Medicine, and many others, the [XAI Lab](/) helped develop this idea into a recurring teaching course. The organizing team later expanded to include **Anastasiia Derzhanskaia** and **Eva Kvindt**.

This term marks the third iteration of the AI-Lab. I’m excited to see how the project continues to evolve. The lab is open to all students interested in exploring both the opportunities and the ethical challenges of AI. Whether you are a programmer, a philosopher, or simply curious, your perspective is welcome.
