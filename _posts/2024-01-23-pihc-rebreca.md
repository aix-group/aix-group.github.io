Pioneers in Healthcare is an innovation fund awarded by University of Twente, Saxion, MST, ZGT and Deventer Hospital awarding projects with impact on health care aiming to foster long-standing collaboration. 

Our project *ReBreCa - AI-driven Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Realistic Clinical Workflows* is a spin-off of the work of PhD candidate Shreyasi Pathak, who is jointly supervised by the University of Marburg, the University of Twente, and ZGT hospital. The aim of ReBreCa is to develop a prediction model for breast cancer diagnosis based on the data constraints in a realistic hospital setting.
