With the goal to provide both robust object detection and reduction of computational complexity for situated interpretation of urban imagery, we propose to apply the 'Informative Descriptor Approach' on SIFT features (i-SIFT descriptors). We learn an attentive matching of i-SIFT keypoints, resulting in a signi cant improvement of state-of-the-art SIFT descriptor based keypoint matching. In the online learning stage, rstly, standard SIFT responses are evaluated using an information theoretic quality criterion with respect to object semantics, rejecting features with insufficient conditional entropy measure, producing both sparse and discriminative object representations. Secondly, we learn a decision tree from the training data set that maps SIFT descriptors to entropy values. The key advantages of informative SIFT (i-SIFT) to standard SIFT encoding are argued from observations on performance complexity, and demonstrated in a typical outdoor mobile vision experiment on the MPG-20 reference database.},

In the proposed application scenario, tourist pedestrians are equipped with GPS, W-LAN and a camera attached to a PDA or a camera phone. They are interested whether their field of view contains tourist sights that would point to more detailed information. Multimedia type data about related history, the architecture, or other related cultural context of historic or artistic relevance might be explored by a mobile user who is intending to learn within the urban environment. Ambient learning is in this way achieved by pointing the device towards the urban sight, capturing an image, and consequently getting information about the object on site and within the focus of attention, i.e., the user?s current field of view.},

Selection is applied first to reduce the complexity of the object model and second to accelerate detection by selective filtering. We present results on the MPG-20 mobile phone imagery with severe illumination, scale and viewpoint changes in the images, performing with 98\% accuracy in identification, efficient (100\%) background rejection, efficient (0\%) false alarm rate, and reliable quality of service under extreme illumination conditions, significantly improving standard SIFT based recognition in every sense, providing (important for mobile vision) runtimes which are 8 ( 24) times faster for the MPG-20 (ZuBuD) database.},

In urban environments, recognition of buildings might play a dominant role in robotic systems that need object based navigation, that take advantage of visual feedback and multimodal information for self-localization, or that enable association to related information from the identified semantics. We present a new method - the informative local features approach - based on an information theoretic saliency measure that is rapidly derived from a local Parzen window density estimation in feature subspace. From the learning of a decision tree based mapping to informative features, it enables attentive access to discriminative information and thereby significantly speeds up the recognition process. This approach is highly robust with respect to severe degrees of partial occlusion, noise, and tolerant to some changes in scale and illumination. We present performance evaluation on our publicly available reference object database (TSG-20) that demonstrates the efficiency of this approach, case wise even outperforming the SIFT feature approach [1]. Building recognition will be advantageous in various application domains, such as, mobile mapping, unmanned vehicle navigation, and systems for car driver assistance.},

By attentive matching of i-SIFT keypoints, we provide an innovative method on object detection that signifantly improves SIFT based keypoint matching. i-SIFT tackles the SIFT bottlenecks, e.g., extensive nearest neighbor indexing, by (i) signifantly reducing the descriptor dimensionality, (ii) decreasing the size of object representation by one order of magnitude, and (iii) performing matching exclusively on attended descriptors, as required by resource sensitive devices. The key advantages of informative SIFT (i-SIFT) are demonstrated in a typical outdoor mobile vision experiment on the TSG-20 reference database, detecting buildings with high accuracy.},

This work contributes to this research by a thorough analysis of the discriminative power of local appearance patterns and by proposing to exploit local information content to model object representation and recognition. We identify discriminative regions in the object views from a posterior entropy measure, and then derive object models from selected discriminative local patterns. For recognition, we determine rapid attentive search for locations of high information content from learned decision trees. The recognition system is evaluated by various degrees of partial occlusion and Gaussian image noise, resulting in highly robust recognition even in the presence of severe occlusion effects.},

  abstract  = {Automatically linking Wikipedia pages is done mostly by two strategies: (i) a content based strategy based on word similarities or (ii) a structural similarity exploiting link characteristics. In our approach we focus on a content based strategy by finding anchors using the title of candidate Wikipedia pages and resolving matching links by taking the context of the link anchor, i.e. its surrounding text, into account. Bestentry-points are estimated on a combination of title and content based similarity. Our goal was to evaluate syntactic title matching properties and the influence of the context around anchors for disambiguation and best-entry-point detection. Results show, that the whole Wikipedia page provides the best context for resolving links and that simple inverse document frequency based scoring of anchor texts is also capable of achieving high accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Wikipedia contains an enormous amount of human knowledge. The wide range of covered topics is hierarchically organized in categories and strongly inter-linked. Its structure, its size and the fact that it is generated by humans are the reasons for the attention Wikipedia receives from researchers in different fields. Especially the link structure of Wikipedia is of huge importance not only for humans browsing the collection, but also as a resource for bootstrapping machine intelligence and the semantic web. Motivated by the fact that manual maintenance and creation of hyperlinks is labor intensive, this paper explores properties for automatic link creation between Wikipedia pages in this paper. Focusing on ad-hoc linking approaches we evaluate linking strategies on the word as well as on the document level using a standard test data set. As it is shown, rather simple approaches yield to reliable results and may be applicable in different application scenarios. Disambiguation strategies based on standard IR techniques help to boost accuracy delivering reasonable results.},

Two German publishers of traditional encyclopedias have reacted to this challenge and started an initiative to merge their corpora to create a single, more complete encyclopedia. The crucial step in this merging process is the alignment of articles. We have developed a two-step hybrid system to provide high-accurate alignments with low manual effort. First, we apply an information retrieval based, automatic alignment algorithm. Second, the articles with a low confidence score are revised using a manual alignment scheme carefully designed for quality assurance. Our evaluation shows that a combination of weighting and ranking techniques utilizing different facets of the encyclopedia articles allow to effectively reduce the number of necessary manual alignments. Further, the setup of the manual alignment turned out to be robust against inter-indexer inconsistencies. As a result, the developed system empowered us to align four encyclopedias with high accuracy and low effort.},

Multimedia type data about related history might be explored by a mobile user who is intending to learn within the urban environment. Ambient learning is in this way achieved by pointing the device towards the urban sight, capturing an image, and consequently getting information about the object on site and within the focus of attention, i.e., the user's current field of view.

  abstract  = {The contribution of this work is to provide a three-stage architecture for sequential attention to provide a system being capable of sensorimotor object detection in real world environments. The first processing stage provides selected foci of interest in the image based on the extraction of information theoretic saliency of local image descriptors (i-SIFT). The second stage investigates the information in the local attention window using a codebook matcher, providing local weak hypotheses about the identity of the object under investigation. The third stage then proposes a shift of attention to a next attention window. The working hypothesis is to expect a better discrimination from the integration of both the individual local {FOA} patterns and the geometric relation between them, providing a model of more global information representation, and feeding into a recognition state in the Markov Decision Process ({MDP}). A reinforcement learner (Q-learner) performs then explorative search on useful actions, i.e., shifts of attention, towards locations of salient information, developing a strategy of useful action sequences being directed in state space towards the optimization of discrimination by information maximization. The method is evaluated in experiments using the COIL-20 database (indoor imagery) and the TSG-20 database (outdoor imagery) to demonstrate efficient performance in object detection tasks, proving the method being more accurate and computationally much less expensive than standard SIFT based recognition},

Selection is applied first to reduce the complexity of the object model and second to accelerate detection by selective filtering. We present results on the MPG-20 mobile phone imagery with severe illumination, scale and viewpoint changes in the images, performing with 98\% accuracy in identification, efficient (100\%) background rejection, effficient (0\%) false alarm rate, and reliable quality of service under extreme illumination conditions, significantly improving standard SIFT based recognition in every sense, providing (important for mobile vision ) runtimes which are 8 (24) times faster for the MPG-20 (ZuBuD) database.},

In a rst processing stage, salient image locations are determined from the local entropy in object discrimination. Local information in terms of code book vector responses contribute to the recognition state in the {MDP}. A reinforcement learner performs then trial and error search on useful actions towards salient locations within a neighborhood, receiving reward from entropy decreases.

A visualization dashboard with many different options can be used to filter the results. Users who are searching a specific topic e.g. in Wikipedia can find more related quality content on their topic through the Chrome Extension. Users who write a text in Google Docs can use the plugin to get references etc.

All EEXCESS developments are open source and can be used and adapted freely.
Libraries or cultural institutions like museums etc. who own repositories can submit their content for inclusion into EEXCESS. Among the content providers so far are Europeana, Mendeley, The Digital Public Library of America , The National Archives UK, Swissbib, Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek, Rijksmuseum {\^a} The Museum of the Netherlands, and Core.ac.uk, so that more than 150 Mio items are potentially recommended through EEXCESS. New content can be easily submitted through an Application Program Interface (API) supporting search functionalities.

A number of prototypes were developed in the project that are now available for public use. The benefit of the prototypes so far still depends on the focus of the search. As more content partners are included the recommendations cover more and more subject areas.

Privacy preservation is one of the key objectives of the project.},

A lot of research effort has been invested in development of algorithmic methods supporting automatic discovery of mappings between ontological concepts. However, automatic alignment remains potentially prone to errors especially with large real-world ontologies, demanding intervention of domain experts. We therefore created a semi-automatic tool including algorithmic alignment methods and an interactive visual interface. Visualisation components included in the interface support experts in navigating the concept space and reviewing the automatically generated mapping suggestions. An experiment with 15 test users was performed to evaluate whether, and in which cases the use of visualisation is beneficial compared to a user interface employing standard GUI widgets. The results indicate that users typically executed tasks slightly faster with an interface using standard widgets, but an interface which includes a visualisation component providing overview, filter and narrowing-down functionality achieved higher rates of successful task completion.},

We propose a system of sequential attention for object recognition that (i) groups n-tuples of local gradient based image descriptors (Lowe, 2004 International Journal of Computer Vision 60 91 - 110) being scale, rotation, and to high degree illumination tolerant, defining a vocabulary of prototypical code descriptors, (ii) selects only informative groupings for further processing, (iii) learns a predictive mapping from a current perceptual state in a Markov decision process to a next saccadic action, and (iv) present a model of object recognition being capable of integrating sequential information by minimization of entropy in the Bayesian modelling of object hypotheses. The innovative abstraction level of informative groupings provides perceptual meta-states in sensory-motor attention, enabling the learning of a purposeful grammar integrating atomic feature-saccade mappings into a meaningful recognition behaviour. We demonstrate highly accurate recognition of outdoor facades in a mobile vision application, using the sensory-motor context of trans-saccadic object recognition.},

For this purpose, we propose to apply the 'Informative Descriptor Approach' on the SIFT descriptor [4], in order to define the informative SIFT (i-SIFT) descriptor. By attentive matching of i-SIFT keypoints, we provide an innovative method on object detection that significantly improves SIFT based keypoint matching. i-SIFT tackles the SIFT bottlenecks, e.g., extensive nearest neighbor indexing, by (i) significantly reducing the descriptor dimensionality, (ii) decreasing the size of object representation by one order of magnitude, and (iii) performing matching exclusively on attended descriptors, as required by resource sensitive devices. The key advantages of informative SIFT (i-SIFT) are demonstrated in a typical outdoor mobile vision experiment on the TSG-20 reference database, detecting buildings with high accuracy.},

Such strategies incorporate the user as oracle: the classifier selects the most appropriate example and the user provides the label. While this approach is tailored towards the classifier, more intelligent input from the user may be beneficial. For instance, given only one example at a time users are hardly able to determine whether this example is an outlier or not. In this paper we propose user-based visually-supported active learning strategies that allow the user to do both, selecting and labeling examples given a trained classifier. While labeling is straightforward, selection takes place using a interactive visualization of the classifier's a-posteriori output probabilities. By simulating different user selection strategies we show, that user-based active learning outperforms uncertainty based sampling methods and yields a more robust approach on different data sets. The obtained results point towards the potential of combining active learning strategies with results from the field of information visualization.},

Getting an overview of information or explorative access to information becomes increasingly difficult with the exponentially increasing amount of information. Search result visualizations, especially for faceted browsing, aim at supporting users to find their way through large document collections. We propose FacetScape, a novel visualization for navigation and refinement of search results allowing users to visually construct complex boolean search queries for narrowing down the search space. This visualization combines Voronoi subdivision and a tag cloud representation of the search facets. Further it includes a preview of action (query preview) and interactions to allow users to focus on important aspects of the data for the task at hand. In a comparative user study with 15 users we compared the visualization to a standard faceted browsing interface for different types of search tasks. The study revealed that participants used the unfamiliar interface as efficiently and effectively as the familiar tree-like display. Results indicate that the FacetScape is a promising way of supporting users in exploring the faceted search space.},

The algorithms address issues found in many common approaches, for example large whitespaces, overlapping tags and restriction to specific boundaries. The layouts computed by these algorithms are compact and clear, have small whitespaces and may feature arbitrary convex polygons as boundaries. The results of the user study and the technical evaluation enable designers to devise a combination of algorithm and parameters which produces satisfying tag cloud layouts for many application scenarios.},

Visualizations of classification models can create understanding and trust in data mining models. However, existing visualizations are often complex or restricted to specific classifiers and attributes. In this work, we propose an intuitive visualization system to observe and understand classification processes and results. Our system can handle multiple classes, nominal and numeric attributes, and supports all classifiers whose predictions can be interpreted as probabilities. We state that the possibility to observe the training process of a classifier boosts the understanding of classification results also for non-expert users. In combination with an intuitive visualization, we provide a system to generate in-depth understanding of classification processes and results. Our simulations revealed that the system could support the user to better understand a classifier's decision, and to gain insights into classification processes.},

  abstract  = {Challenges in Visual Analytics frequently involve massive repositories, which do not only contain a large number of information artefacts, but also a high number of relevant dimensions per artefact. Dimensionality reduction algorithms are commonly used to transform high-dimensional data into low- dimensional representations which are suitable for visualisation purposes. For example, Information Landscapes visualise high-dimensional data in two dimensions using distance-preserving projection methods. The inaccuracies introduced by such methods are usually expressed through a global stress measure which does not provide insight into localised phenomena. In this paper, we propose the use of Stress Maps, a combination of heat maps and information landscapes, to support algorithm development and optimization based on local stress measures. We report on an application of Stress Maps to a scalable text projection algorithm and describe two categories of problems related to localised stress phenomena which we have identified using the proposed method.},

  abstract   = {In text classification the amount and quality of training data is crucial for the performance of the classifier. The generation of training data is done by human labellers - a tedious and time-consuming work. To reduce the labelling time for single documents we propose to use condensed representations of text documents instead of the full-text document. These condensed representations are key sentences and key phrases and can be generated in a fully unsupervised way. We extended and evaluated the TextRank algorithm to automatically extract key sentences and key phrases. For representing key phrases we propose a layout similar to a tag cloud. In a user study with 37 participants we evaluated whether document labelling with these condensed representations can be done faster and equally accurate by the human labellers. Our evaluation shows that the users labelled tag clouds twice as fast and as accurately as full-text documents. While further investigations for different classification tasks are necessary, this insight could potentially reduce costs for the labelling process of text documents.},

Therefore, we propose collection-document (CDS) summaries that highlight commonalities and differences between a collection (or a single document) and a single document. We devise evaluation metrics that do not require human judgement, and three algorithms for extracting CDS that are based on single-document keyword-extraction methods. Our evaluation shows that different algorithms have different strengths, e.g. TF-IDF based approach best describes document overlap while the adaption of Rake provides keywords with a broad topical coverage. The proposed criteria and procedure can be used to evaluate document-collection summaries without annotated corpora or provide additional insight in an evaluation with human-generated ground truth.},

  abstract = {Indexing documents with controlled vocabularies enables a wealth of semantic applications for digital libraries. Due to the rapid growth of scientific publications, machine learning-based methods are required that assign subject descriptors automatically. While stability of generative processes behind the underlying data is often assumed tacitly, it is being violated in practice. Addressing this problem, this article studies explicit and implicit concept drift, that is, settings with new descriptor terms and new types of documents, respectively. First, the existence of concept drift in automatic subject indexing is discussed in detail and demonstrated by example. Subsequently, architectures for automatic indexing are analyzed in this regard, highlighting individual strengths and weaknesses. The results of the theoretical analysis justify research on fusion of different indexing approaches with special consideration on information sharing among descriptors. Experimental results on titles and author keywords in the domain of economics underline the relevance of the fusion methodology, especially under concept drift. Fusion approaches outperformed non-fusion strategies on the tested data sets, which comprised shifts in priors of descriptors as well as covariates. These findings can help researchers and practitioners in digital libraries to choose appropriate methods for automatic subject indexing, as is finally shown by a recent case study.},

  abstract = {Having insight into the causal associations in a complex system facilitates decision making, e.g., for medical treatments, urban infrastructure improvements or financial investments. The amount of observational data grows, which enables the discovery of causal relationships between variables from observation of their behaviour in time. Existing methods for causal discovery from time series data do not yet exploit the representational power of deep learning. We therefore present the Temporal Causal Discovery Framework (TCDF), a deep learning framework that learns a causal graph structure by discovering causal relationships in observational time series data. TCDF uses attention-based convolutional neural networks combined with a causal validation step. By interpreting the internal parameters of the convolutional networks, TCDF can also discover the time delay between a cause and the occurrence of its effect. Our framework learns temporal causal graphs, which can include confounders and instantaneous effects. Experiments on financial and neuroscientific benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance of TCDF on discovering causal relationships in continuous time series data. Furthermore, we show that TCDF can circumstantially discover the presence of hidden confounders. Our broadly applicable framework can be used to gain novel insights into the causal dependencies in a complex system, which is important for reliable predictions, knowledge discovery and data-driven decision making.},

Despite these findings, today’s search user interfaces do not support non-linear navigation, like for example backtracking in time. We propose QueryCrumbs, a compact and easy-to-understand visualization for navigating the search query history supporting iterative query refinement. We apply a multi-layered interface design to support novices and first-time users as well as intermediate and expert users. The visualization is evaluated with novice users in a formative user study, with experts in a think aloud test and its usage in a long-term study with software logging. The formative evaluation showed that the interactions can be easily performed, and the visual encodings were well understood without instructions. Results indicate that QueryCrumbs can support users when searching for information in an iterative manner. The evaluation with experts showed that expert users can gain valuable insights into the back-end search engine by identifying specific patterns in the visualization. In a long-term usage study, we observed an uptake of the visualization, indicating that users deem QueryCrumbs beneficial for their search interactions.},

Privacy concerns prevent the distribution of EHRs, and the annotation of data is known to be costly and cumbersome. Synthetic data presents a promising solution to the privacy concern, if synthetic data has comparable utility to real data and if it preserves the privacy of patients. However, the generation of synthetic text alone is not useful for NLP because of the lack of annotations. In this work, we propose the use of neural language models (LSTM and GPT-2) for generating artificial EHR text jointly with annotations for named-entity recognition. Our experiments show that artificial documents can be used to train a supervised named-entity recognition model for de-identification, which outperforms a state-of-the-art rule-based baseline. Moreover, we show that combining real data with synthetic data improves the recall of the method, without manual annotation effort. We conduct a user study to gain insights on the privacy of artificial text. We highlight privacy risks associated with language models to inform future research on privacy-preserving automated text generation and metrics for evaluating privacy-preservation during text generation.},

  abstract       = {Machine learning models have been successfully applied for analysis of skin images. However, due to the black box nature of such deep learning models, it is difficult to understand their underlying reasoning. This prevents a human from validating whether the model is right for the right reasons. Spurious correlations and other biases in data can cause a model to base its predictions on such artefacts rather than on the true relevant information. These learned shortcuts can in turn cause incorrect performance estimates and can result in unexpected outcomes when the model is applied in clinical practice. This study presents a method to detect and quantify this shortcut learning in trained classifiers for skin cancer diagnosis, since it is known that dermoscopy images can contain artefacts. Specifically, we train a standard VGG16-based skin cancer classifier on the public ISIC dataset, for which colour calibration charts (elliptical, coloured patches) occur only in benign images and not in malignant ones. Our methodology artificially inserts those patches and uses inpainting to automatically remove patches from images to assess the changes in predictions. We find that our standard classifier partly bases its predictions of benign images on the presence of such a coloured patch. More importantly, by artificially inserting coloured patches into malignant images, we show that shortcut learning results in a significant increase in misdiagnoses, making the classifier unreliable when used in clinical practice. With our results, we, therefore, want to increase awareness of the risks of using black box machine learning models trained on potentially biased datasets. Finally, we present a model-agnostic method to neutralise shortcut learning by removing the bias in the training dataset by exchanging coloured patches with benign skin tissue using image inpainting and re-training the classifier on this de-biased dataset.},

While powerful in prediction accuracy, Deep Learning models are black boxes by nature, preventing users from making informed judgments about the correctness and fairness of such an automated system. Explanations have been proposed as a general remedy to the black box problem. However, it remains unclear if effects of explanations on user trust generalise over varying accuracy levels. In an online user study with 959 participants, we examined the practical consequences of adding explanations for user trust: We evaluated trust for three explanation types on three classifiers of varying accuracy. We find that the influence of our explanations on trust differs depending on the classifier’s accuracy. Thus, the interplay between trust and explanations is more complex than previously reported. Our findings also reveal discrepancies between self-reported and behavioural trust, showing that the choice of trust measure impacts the results.},

In recent years, research on evaluating Information Retrieval (IR) systems has mainly focused on simulation as means to improve users models and evaluation metrics about the performance of search engines using test collections and user studies. However, test collections contain no user interaction data and user studies are expensive to conduct. Thus there is a need in developing a methodology for evaluating simulated user sessions. In this paper, we propose evaluation metrics to assess the realism of simulated sessions and describe a pilot study to assess the capability of generating simulated search sequences representing an approximation of real behaviour. Our findings highlight the importance of investigating and utilising classification-based metrics besides the distribution-based ones in the evaluation process.},

  abstract  = {Search engine users issue queries to formulate their information need and gain useful insights. However, it is challenging for search engines to understand different users’ search type intents and re- turn appropriate results. Simulating user search behaviour allows information retrieval systems (IR) to parameterise the a-priori dis- tribution of search types using different back-end configurations and user interface variants to improve the retrieval functionality. In this paper, we propose a formal Markov approach in which we utilise the context discovery process to model user-type specific behaviour by capturing the user’s query change in a search session. Contextual Markov models have been used in the past to improve the prediction of user intentions, we investigate here their effi- ciency in simulating user-type specific interactions. Additionally, we provide an empirical and classification-based evaluation that can be used in simulation assessment. Overall, we report that the proposed approach reliably simulates user-type specific behaviour on a real-world academic search engine log dataset.},

  abstract  = {This work is about a novel methodology for window detection in urban environments and its multiple use in vision system applications. The presented method for window detection includes appropriate early image processing, provides a multi-scale Haar wavelet representation for the determination of image tiles which is then fed into a cascaded classifier for the task of window detection. The classifier is learned from a Gentle Adaboost driven cascaded decision tree [1] on masked information from training imagery and is tested towards window based ground truth information which is - together with the original building image databases - publicly available [10, 11, 13]. The experimental results demonstrate that single window detection is to a sufficient degree successful, e.g., for the purpose of building recognition, and, furthermore, that the classifier is in general capable to provide a region of interest operator for the interpretation of urban environments. The extraction of this categorical information is beneficial to index into search spaces for urban object recognition as well as aiming towards providing a semantic focus for accurate post-processing in 3D information processing systems. Targeted applications are (i) mobile services on uncalibrated imagery, e.g. , for tourist guidance, (ii) sparse 3D city modeling, and (iii) deformation analysis from high resolution imagery.},

  abstract = {Proximal femur fractures represent a major health concern, and substantially contribute to the morbidity of elderly. Correct classification and diagnosis of hip fractures has a significant impact on mortality, costs and hospital stay. In this paper, we present a method and empirical validation for automatic subclassification of proximal femur fractures and Dutch radiological report generation that does not rely on manually curated data. The fracture classification model was trained on 11,000 X-ray images obtained from 5000 electronic health records in a general hospital. To generate the Dutch reports, we first trained an embedding model on 20,000 radiological reports of pelvic region fractures, and used its embeddings in the report generation model. We trained the report generation model on the 5000 radiological reports associated with the fracture cases. Our report generation model is on par with state-of-the-art in terms of BLEU and ROUGE scores. This is promising, because in contrast to those earlier works, our approach does not require manual preprocessing of either images or the reports. This boosts the applicability of automatic clinical report generation in practice. A quantitative and qualitative user study among medical students found no significant difference in provenance of real and generated reports. A qualitative, in-depth clinical relevance study with medical domain experts showed that from a human perspective the quality of the generated reports approximates the quality of the original reports and highlights challenges in creating sufficiently detailed and versatile training data for automatic radiology report generation.},

In this study, we empirically evaluate a more powerful ensemble learning algorithm, multi-view stacked generalization, on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease and adult colorectal cancer patients&rsquo; cohorts. We aim to check whether stacking would lead to better results compared to using a single best machine learning algorithm. Stacking achieves the best test set Average Precision (AP) on inflammatory bowel disease dataset reaching AP = 0.69, outperforming both the best base classifier (AP = 0.61) and the baseline meta learner built on top of base classifiers (AP = 0.63). On colorectal cancer dataset, the stacked classifier also outperforms (AP = 0.81) both the best base classifier (AP = 0.79) and the baseline meta learner (AP = 0.75). Stacking achieves best predictive performance on test set outperforming the best classifiers on both patient cohorts. Application of the stacking solves the issue of choosing the most appropriate machine learning algorithm by automating the model selection procedure. Clinical application of such a model is not limited to diagnosis task only, but it also can be extended to biomarker selection thanks to feature selection procedure.},

While interpretability and explainability are often presented as a subjectively validated binary property, we consider it a multi-faceted concept. We identify 12 conceptual properties, such as Compactness and Correctness, that should be evaluated for comprehensively assessing the quality of an explanation. Our so-called Co-12 properties serve as categorization scheme for systematically reviewing the evaluation practices of more than 300 papers published in the last 7 years at major AI and ML conferences that introduce an XAI method. We find that 1 in 3 papers evaluate exclusively with anecdotal evidence, and 1 in 5 papers evaluate with users. This survey also contributes to the call for objective, quantifiable evaluation methods by presenting an extensive overview of quantitative XAI evaluation methods. Our systematic collection of evaluation methods provides researchers and practitioners with concrete tools to thoroughly validate, benchmark and compare new and existing XAI methods. The Co-12 categorization scheme and our identified evaluation methods open up opportunities to include quantitative metrics as optimization criteria during model training in order to optimize for accuracy and interpretability simultaneously.},

The verified XAI explanations are then compared with explanations from a domain expert, to indirectly determine the reliability of the model. BERTje, a Dutch Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, outperforms RobBERT and MedRoBERTa.nl in both accuracy and reliability. The latter model (MedRoBERTa.nl) is a domain-specific model, while BERTje is a generic model, showing that domain-specific models are not always superior.

  abstract = {Since recent achievements of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have proven significant success and promising results throughout many fields of application during the last decade, AI has also become an essential part of medical research. The improving data availability, coupled with advances in high-performance computing and innovative algorithms, has increased AI's potential in various aspects. Because AI rapidly reshapes research and promotes the development of personalized clinical care, alongside its implementation arises an urgent need for a deep understanding of its inner workings, especially in high-stake domains. However, such systems can be highly complex and opaque, limiting the possibility of an immediate understanding of the system’s decisions. Regarding the medical field, a high impact is attributed to these decisions as physicians and patients can only fully trust AI systems when reasonably communicating the origin of their results, simultaneously enabling the identification of errors and biases. Explainable AI (XAI), becoming an increasingly important field of research in recent years, promotes the formulation of explainability methods and provides a rationale allowing users to comprehend the results generated by AI systems. In this paper, we investigate the application of XAI in medical imaging, addressing a broad audience, especially healthcare professionals. The content focuses on definitions and taxonomies, standard methods and approaches, advantages, limitations, and examples representing the current state of research regarding XAI in medical imaging. This paper focuses on saliency-based XAI methods, where the explanation can be provided directly on the input data (image) and which naturally are of special importance in medical imaging.},

  abstract = {Driven by recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV), the implementation of AI systems in the medical domain increased correspondingly. This is especially true for the domain of medical imaging, in which the incorporation of AI aids several imaging-based tasks such as classification, segmentation, and registration. Moreover, AI reshapes medical research and contributes to the development of personalized clinical care. Consequently, alongside its extended implementation arises the need for an extensive understanding of AI systems and their inner workings, potentials, and limitations which the field of eXplainable AI (XAI) aims at. Because medical imaging is mainly associated with visual tasks, most explainability approaches incorporate saliency-based XAI methods. In contrast to that, in this article we would like to investigate the full potential of XAI methods in the field of medical imaging by specifically focusing on XAI techniques not relying on saliency, and providing diversified examples. We dedicate our investigation to a broad audience, but particularly healthcare professionals. Moreover, this work aims at establishing a common ground for cross-disciplinary understanding and exchange across disciplines between Deep Learning (DL) builders and healthcare professionals, which is why we aimed for a non-technical overview. Presented XAI methods are divided by a method’s output representation into the following categories: Case-based explanations, textual explanations, and auxiliary explanations.},

However, individual datapoints do not always provide enough clear evidence to make confident suggestions. Although methods exist that enable systems to identify those datapoints and subsequently abstain from suggesting a label, it remains unclear how users would react to such system behavior. This paper presents first findings from a user study on systems that do or do not abstain from labeling ambiguous datapoints. Our results show that label suggestions on ambiguous datapoints bear a high risk of unconsciously influencing the users’ decisions, even toward incorrect ones. Furthermore, participants perceived a system that abstains from labeling uncertain datapoints as equally competent and trustworthy as a system that delivers label suggestions for all datapoints. Consequently, if abstaining does not impair a system’s credibility, it can be a useful mechanism to increase decision quality.},
